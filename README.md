# Prediction-of-diabetes-using-machine-learning
The project involved the implementation of various machine learning algorithms on a dataset consisting of 280,000 samples. These algorithms were employed to predict the presence of diabetes within the dataset, achieving highly accurate results.The research examined the relationship between various health metrics—such as BMI, age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, general health, physical fitness, mobility challenges, and income—and the onset of diabetes. These factors were recognized as key contributors to an individual's diabetes risk.The study utilized eight different machine learning models—Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Neural Networks, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes—to identify type 2 diabetes, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to reduce dataset dimensionality.The findings highlighted that low-income individuals face a disproportionate burden of treatment costs associated with diabetes, especially within expensive healthcare systems like that of the United States. This underscores the need for future research to explore the economic consequences of diabetes more deeply, with the goal of reducing both diagnostic and non-diagnostic costs and easing the financial strain on those affected.The study also included numerous graphs that visually represent the dataset's characteristics and illustrate the corresponding outcomes.
